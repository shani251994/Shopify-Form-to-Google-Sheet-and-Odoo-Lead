# Shopify to Odoo & Google Sheets Lead Integration

This project integrates a Shopify contact form with Odoo CRM and Google Sheets. When a customer submits the contact form on your Shopify site, the data is sent to:

1. **Odoo CRM** ‚Äì to create a new lead and customer (if not already existing).
2. **Google Sheets** ‚Äì to log the submitted data for backup or reporting purposes.

---

## üîß How It Works

- The **Shopify form script** captures the form data and sends it via `fetch()` to:
  - A custom **Odoo HTTP controller** (`/shopify/lead`)
  - A **Google Apps Script Web App** that logs the data in a spreadsheet
- Both requests are asynchronous and run before the form is submitted normally to Shopify.

---

## üìÅ Components

### 1. Odoo Controller (Python)

Creates a `res.partner` and `crm.lead` in Odoo from incoming Shopify form data.

### 2. Google Apps Script (JavaScript)

Appends the submitted form data to a Google Sheet.

### 3. Shopify Script (JavaScript)

Intercepts the Shopify form submit event and sends the data to both Odoo and Google Sheets endpoints.
